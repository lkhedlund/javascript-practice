# Javascript Practice
Javascript functions, frameworks, and tutorials I've been playing around with.

**Friendly Warning: projects and scripts in here might not be complete.**

### About
You can get a good sense of what I've been trying out and playing with in the way of new technologies, if that's something that interests you.

### Structure
Each project or tutorial will get its own folder that more or less describes what it is. A complex project that isn't moved to its own repo might have a new readme file. 

**Basically, anything goes. Enjoy!**
